      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project of butler robot is basically an idea of interfacing the computer vision with the present day robotics .This is one of the long term projects which has a decent scope of advancement in manual assistance , machine learning and artificial intelligence. Keeping these aspects of this project in mind , our team from IVLABS  took a step towards the advancement and development of butler robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​The butler bot works on Robot Operating System (ROS).The robot is steered using an android app. The butler is actuated using the means of specially designed structure that includes power screw and Omni wheels. The robot can supervise different localities using its teleprescence attribute. This robot is a test bed for algorithms ,software and other technology that will enable robots to perform challenging manipulation and tasks such SLAM(simultaneous localisation and mapping),gaming simulation and other control applications such as voice recognition and following a person which is called the follow-me attribute. We are using kinect sensor to recognise you and detect hand gestures and work accordingly. By using on board Pico projector the butler bot can project on the walls of your home. This make butler bot a great source of entertainment it’s like having a computer with you every time and you can access internet, watch movies, photos and lot more ….&lt;/p&gt;
