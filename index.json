Majority of the techniques in reinforcement learning depend upon the reward from the environment to select the actions which maximize the overall reward. However, in real-world scenario such explicit rewards might be sparse or even not available to the agent. The idea of Curiosity-Driven learning, is to build a reward function that is intrinsic to the agent (generated by the agent itself).

Keeping these aspects of this project in mind , our team from IVLABS took a step towards the advancement and development of butler robots.\n​The butler bot works on Robot Operating System (ROS).The robot is steered using an android app. The butler is actuated using the means of specially designed structure that includes power screw and Omni wheels. The robot can supervise different localities using its teleprescence attribute. This robot is a test bed for algorithms ,software and other technology that will enable robots to perform challenging manipulation and tasks such SLAM(simultaneous localisation and mapping),gaming simulation and other control applications such as voice recognition and following a person which is called the follow-me attribute. We are using kinect sensor to recognise you and detect hand gestures and work accordingly. By using on board Pico projector the butler bot can project on the walls of your home.

Registration is the process of finding the spatial transformation that aligns a point cloud to a geometric model, defined in different reference frames. When the correspondences between the points in the two reference frames are known, spatial transformation can be found using a least squares based approach. However, in most practical applications, the correspondence is unknown. By iteratively finding the best correspondence and the optimal transformation given that correspondence, Besl et al. developed the iterativeclosest point (ICP). In this work, we compare two registration methods ICP and Go-ICP, discussing the benefits and drawbacks of each method and drawing conclusion through analysis of results from each method.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"52c3bd7d3e9bc180463473a415953c1d","permalink":"https://kartiksonu.github.io/project/icp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/icp/","section":"project","summary":"Computer Vision course project.","tags":["python","OpenCV"],"title":"ICP","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Robots have long been used in the operation theaters primarily for a wide variety of applications ranging from neurosurgery to laparoscopic surgery.

Such semantic information can enable a robot to better distinguish places with similar low-level geometric and visual features and perform high-level tasks that use semantic information about objects to be manipulated and environments to be navigated. While semantic SLAM has gained increasing attention, there is little research on semantic- level data association based on semantic objects, i.e., object-level data association. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level data association algorithm based on bag of words algorithm [1], formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem. With object-level data association solved, we develop a quadratic-programming-based semantic object initialization scheme using dual quadric and introduce additional constraints to improve the success rate of object initialization. The inte- grated semantic-level SLAM system can achieve high-accuracy object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping as demonstrated in the experiments. The online semantic map building and semantic-level localization capabilities facilitate semantic-level mapping and task planning in a priori unknown environment.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b2b95bd4ebc9a74171b5c64751927119","permalink":"https://kartiksonu.github.io/project/semantic-slam/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/semantic-slam/","section":"project","summary":"Integrated semantic-level SLAM system that can achieve highly-accurate object-level data association and real-time semantic mapping.","tags":["ROS","SLAM","C++"],"title":"Semantic SLAM","type":"project"},{"authors":["Zhentian Qian","Kartik Patath","Jie Fu","Jing Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6e118ca5e54038c690b158b0c2bc07fb","permalink":"https://kartiksonu.github.io/publication/paper5/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper5/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Semantic SLAM with Autonomous Object-Level Data Association","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Zevallos"," R Arun Srivatsan","Hadi Salman","Lu Li","Jianing Qian","Saumya Saxena","Mengyun Xu","Kartik Patath","Howie Choset"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c5f3374425262111b25e02355e6f46d4","permalink":"https://kartiksonu.github.io/publication/paper3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper3/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Surgical system for automatic registration, stiffness mapping and dynamic image overlay","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Search and rescue has always been a critical question to be answered in times of natural disasters.
